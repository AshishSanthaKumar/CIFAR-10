# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

Image classification is of great importance for people to interact with each other and with the natural world. We possess a tremendous capacity for visual recognition, as we can almost easily identify objects encountered in our lives such as animals, faces and food. In particular, humans can easily recognize an object even though it may vary in position, scale, pose and illumination. This ability is called core object recognition and is carried out through the ventral stream of the human visual system. In the field of computer vision, several experiments have tried to build systems capable of imitating the ability of humans to identify objects. Despite several decades of effort, machine visual recognition was far from human performance. Nevertheless, machine performance has improved significantly since the last years, due to the re-emergence of convolutional neural network (CNNs) and deep learning. Like traditional neural networks, which are inspired by biological neural systems, the architecture of CNNs for object recognition is feedforward and consists of several layers in a hierarchical manner. Here, we will try to compare the different methods for classifying images in order to highlight the contribution of Deep learning in the field of Computer Vision.
